    Command	Description
    PING : This command simply returns PONG.
    sentinel masters : Shows a list of all monitored masters + state.
    sentinel master <master name> : Shows the state of a specified master.
    sentinel slaves <master name> : Shows the slaves of the master + state.
    sentinel sentinels <master name> : Shows the Sentinel instances for this master + state
    sentinel get-master-addr-by-name <master name> : Returns the ip and port number of the master with that name. 
         * If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted slave.
    sentinel reset <pattern> : Resets the masters with a matching name. Clears previous state for the master, 
         * removes every slave and sentinel discovered. A fresh discovery is started.
    sentinel failover <master name> : Forces a failover, as if the master was not reachable
    sentinel ckquorum <master name> : Checkes if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach quorum and majority.
         * Replies:
             * +OK 5 usable Sentinels. Quorum and failover authorization can be reached.
             * -NOQUORUM 1 usable Sentinels. Not enough available Sentinels to reach the specified quorum for this master. Not enough available Sentinels to reach the majority and authorize a failover
    sentinel flushconfig : Forces Sentinel to rewrite it’s configuration on disk
    sentinel monitor <master name> <ip> <port> <quorum> : This command tells the Sentinel to start monitoring a new master 
        * with the specified name, ip, port, and quorum. It is identical to the sentinel monitor configuration directive in sentinel.conf configuration file, 
        * with the difference that you can't use an hostname in as ip, but you need to provide an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    sentinel remove <master name> : Removes a specified master from monitoring.
    sentinel set <master name> <option> <value> : Similar to config set with Redis, you can change Sentinel options. 
        * All options at the Sentinel configuration file can also be set here
    sentinel is-master-down-by-addr <ip> <port> : Gets feedback from other Sentinels. 
        * This command replies true if the specified address is the one of a master instance, and the master is in SDOWN state.
        * Returns a two elements multi bulk reply where the first is 0 or 1 (0 if the master with that address is known and is in SDOWN state, 1 otherwise). 
            * The second element of the reply is the subjective leader for this master, that is, the runid of the Redis Sentinel instance that should perform 
            * the failover accordingly to the queried instance.
